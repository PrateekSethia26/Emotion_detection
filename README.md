Developed an emotion detection model using libraries like sklearn, streamlit and many more. It will help in detecting the emotion using text given by the user.
After then, I containerized the model using Docker to ensure seamless deployment across different environments.Users can now interact with the emotion detection system through a user-friendly interface.
